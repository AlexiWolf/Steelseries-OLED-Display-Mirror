# Steelseries-OLED-Display-Mirror

Quick hacked together script to "mirror" your desktop screen to the OLED on a SteelSeries device.

Should support any device with an OLED screen that can be controlled from SteelSeries engine (tested on Artcis Pro GameDac and Apex 7)

To run, install Python 3.8 (should work on any "recent" version really, but you'll need to install different module versions), and `pip install -r requirements.txt`, or use a virtual environment. Edit `main.py` to your liking (top 3 constants), and run.
